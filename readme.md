**Godot Game Template**, also GGT in short, is a simple generic starter project for Godot games.

Provides a solid base for quick iterations.

It worked well when used by small teams in game jams, but it should be generic
enough to work for mid sized teams as well.

# Features Overview

GGT is composed of multiple parts:

1.  **ggt-core** addon
2.  **ggt-shortcuts** addon
3.  Godot project boilerplate (this repository)

**ggt-core** provides:

- Scene management with transitions and optional progress bar
- Parameter passing between scenes
- Multithreaded scene loading
  - single threaded loading fallback for web exports

**ggt-shortcuts** provides:

- Debug shortcuts mapped to keyboard keys for restart (R), pause frame (P), advance frame (.), speed up time scale (SHIFT), quit (Q)
  - if you need those keys for your game, you can easily update the Godot
    Input Map to whatever you like
- Automatic shortcuts removal for release builds

The godot project boilerplate provides:

- GitHub Actions workflows for automatic builds+web deploy on Github Pages after each commit
  - or you can use manual workflow dispatch
  - or you can use a local `release.sh` script to export multiple targets (Windows, Linux, Mac, ...) with a single command
  - or you can export manually from Godot as usual
- A project structure that follows Godot best practices and naming conventions
- Placeholder menu and gameplay scenes with support for keyboard, gamepad or touch inputs
- A preconfigured a global theme for control nodes. Tweak `resources/theme/theme-main.tres` and every control nodes will inherit from it

# Get started

You have 2 options:

## 1. Get started with Github Templates:

1. [Create a new repo using this template](https://github.com/crystal-bit/godot-game-template/generate)
2. Clone the new repository locally
3. Open the project in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download/) (GDScript)

## 2. Get started with a local project:

1. Go to https://github.com/crystal-bit/godot-game-template/releases
2. Download _Source code (zip)_
3. Unzip the project
4. Open the project in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download/) (GDScript) and create your game!

# How to...

## Change scene

```gdscript
GGT.change_scene("res://scenes/gameplay/gameplay.tscn")
```

![change_scene](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6860637/162567110-026c1979-6237-4255-bb2a-97815fc4b0c4.gif)

## Change scene and show progress bar

```gdscript
GGT.change_scene("res://scenes/gameplay/gameplay.tscn", {
  "show_progress_bar": true
})
```

![progress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6860637/162567097-81b5c54e-1ee5-42b9-a583-60764ecff069.gif)

## Change scene and pass parameters

```gdscript
var params = {
  "level": 4,
  "skin": "dark"
}
GGT.change_scene("res://scenes/gameplay/gameplay.tscn", params)
```

Nodes in the loaded scene can read params with:

```gdscript
# gameplay.gd

func _ready():
    var params = GGT.get_current_scene_data().params
    print(params.level) # 4
    print(params.skin)  # 'dark'
   # setup your scene here
```

## Await scene transition to finish

Note: all the tree is already paused during scene transitions, but if you need to
wait for the graphic transition to completely disappear before calling some code you
can use this approach:

```gdscript
# gameplay.gd

func _ready() -> void:
    if GGT.is_changing_scene(): # this will be false for the starting scene or if you start the scene with "Run current scene" or F6 shortcut during development
        await GGT.change_finished
    # activate your game logic here
    pass
```

## Restart the current scene

```gd
GGT.restart_scene() # old params will be reused
```

## Restart the current scene and override params

```gd
var new_params = {
  "level": 5,
}
GGT.restart_scene_with_params(new_params)
```

# addons/ggt-debug-shortcuts

`addons/ggt-debug-shortcuts` is enabled by default and it builds on top of `ggt-core`.

By default it will set these input actions to the project:

| action                    | key        | description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "ggt_debug_pause_game"    | KEY_P      | Pauses the tree                                              |
| "ggt_debug_step_frame"    | KEY_PERIOD | It advances 1 process_frame and 1 physics_frame during pause |
| "ggt_debug_restart_scene" | KEY_R      | Restarts the current scene, with the same parameters         |
| "ggt_debug_quit_game"     | KEY_Q      | Closes the game                                              |
| "ggt_debug_speedup_game"  | KEY_SHIFT  | Sets Engine.time_scale to 2 while holding key                |

You can change, remove or add shortcuts in [debug_shortcuts.gd](./addons/ggt-debug-shortcuts/autoload/debug_shortcuts.gd).

**These shortcuts work in the editor and in debug builds and are automatically removed on release builds.**

# Conventions and project structure

- `assets/`
  - Contains textures, sprites, sounds, music, fonts, ...
- `builds/`
  - output directory for game builds generated via `release.sh` (ignored by .gitignore and .gdignore)
- `scenes/`
  - Contains Godot scenes (both entities, reusable scenes and "game screen" scenes)
  - Scene folders can contain `.gd` scripts or resources used by the scene

Mostly inspired by the official [Godot Engine guidelines][l1]:

- **snake_case** for files and folders (eg: game.gd, game.tscn)
- **PascalCase** for node names (eg: Game, Player)

[l1]: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/project_setup/project_organization.html#style-guide

### Lower Case file names

This convention avoids having filesystem issues on different platforms. Stick with it
and it will save you time. Read more
[here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/project_setup/project_organization.html#case-sensitivity):

> Windows and recent macOS versions use case-insensitive filesystems by default,
> whereas Linux distributions use a case-sensitive filesystem by default. This
> can cause issues after exporting a project, since Godot's PCK virtual
> filesystem is case-sensitive. To avoid this, it's recommended to stick to
> snake_case naming for all files in the project (and lowercase characters in
> general).

See also [this PR](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/82957/files) that adds `is_case_sensitive()`.

### Trim whitespaces on save

If every developer on the team is using the built-in Godot Engine text editor I strongly suggest
to activate this option:

- Editor -> Editor Settings -> Text Editor/Behaviour -> Trim Trailing Whitespace on Save

It avoids whitespace changes that may add noise in team work.

# Export utilities

## `release.sh`

From your project root:

```sh
./release.sh # this assumes that you have a "godot" binary/alias in your $PATH
```

Look inside the ./builds/ directory:

```sh
builds
â””â”€â”€ ProjectName
    â”œâ”€â”€ html5
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ build.log # an export log + build datetime and git hash
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ linux
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectName.x86_64
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ build.log
    â”œâ”€â”€ osx
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectName.dmg
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ build.log
    â””â”€â”€ windows
        â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectName.exe
        â””â”€â”€ build.log
```

## Github Actions

If you are using Github you can take advantage of:

1. automatic exports for every commit push (see [push-export.yml][ci-push-export])
2. manual exports via Github CI (see [dispatch-export.yml][ci-dispatch] )

[ci-push-export]: ./.github/workflows/push-export.yml
[ci-dispatch]: ./.github/workflows/push-export.yml
