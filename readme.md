# Disclaimer

This is not an official Godot template.  

It's an opinionated project that I built to ease my game development workflow.

# Contributing

Development of new versions is made on the [`dev`](https://github.com/crystal-bit/godot-game-template/tree/dev) branch.

If you want to help the project, create games and feel free to report any issue.

If you want to add more features, please open an issue before and let's discuss. 
I want to keep this template small, focused and easy to use.
