# **Bayanihan Spire: Threat Dossier**

**Version: 1.0** **Compatibility:** GDD Version 1.9

**Purpose:** This document is the master list for all Threat abilities and Modifiers. It serves as the primary resource for encounter design, balancing, and AI programming.

### **Part 1: The Threat Modifier System**

A Modifier is a run-wide passive effect that layers on top of a primary Threat. Its name and visual icon change based on the active Threat to ensure thematic integrity.

| Core Mechanic | vs. Mr. Earthquake | vs. Typhoon Yoling | vs. Volcanic Eruption |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Random Discard** | **Sudden Tremor** | **High Winds** | **Blinding Ash** |
| **Block Reduction** | **Unstable Ground** | **Soaking Rain** | **Corrosive Fumes** |
| **Deck Pollution** | **Falling Debris** | **Rising Floodwater** | **Falling Embers** |
| **Heal Reduction** | **Cut Supply Lines** | **Contamination** | **Noxious Gas** |
| **Spirit Drain** | **Panic** | **Exhaustion** | **Suffocation** |

### **Part 2: Threat Dossier**

Threats have a streamlined set of skills that represent their core identity. The strategic complexity comes from their interaction with the Modifier system.

  * `Aftershock` (Payoff): Deals 5 damage for each "Rubble" card in the player's possession (Hand, Draw Pile, Used Pile).
